# Connectsky
Connectsky is a chrome extension based Bluesky / AT Proto Client with its own accessibilities!


## Installation:
To setup Connectsky locally, you need to clone it from our repository first. Then, make sure to install all the necessary dependencies by command ```npm install``` or you can use ```yarn install``` then you're good to go.

### Note:
It will be tricky to run local server of app for Chrome Extension as extensions needs to be built using ```npm run build``` or you can use ```npm run watch``` to auto build while saving code. Then you need to to follow these steps to install it as local dev setup:<br/>
- Go to extensions in Google Chrome <br/>
-  Enable Developer Tools <br/>
-  Click on Load Extension <br/>
-  Select dist folder after building the app in terminal <br/>
-  Then you're good to use. But you can just click on reload icon to reboot the extension. <br/>

## Thing to take care:
- You can make changes to the code and just reload in the app using ```Ctrl + R``` to reload to see changes. <br/>
- If you're changing CSS code & you're using ```npm run watch``` approach then make sure to save the code by going to TSX file to actually auto build it. (We actually faced this issue so took a note here)

## Rules for contributors:
- Make sure to create a PR with appropriate names with detailed comments.
- We might not accept your PR if it isn't appropriate.
